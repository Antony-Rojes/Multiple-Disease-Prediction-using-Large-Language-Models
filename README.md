<h1>Multiple-Disease-Prediction-using-Large-Language-Models</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on predicting multiple diseases using Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with machine learning and data-driven approaches. The system analyzes user-provided symptoms and medical-related inputs to assist in identifying the possible presence of diseases at an early stage.

The aim is to demonstrate how modern AI models can support healthcare decision-making (for educational and research purposes only).

<h2>Objectives</h2>

Predict multiple diseases from input symptoms

Leverage Large Language Models for intelligent analysis

Provide fast and user-friendly disease prediction

Assist early diagnosis and awareness
